"""
Pre-defined safe waypoints for major straits.

Strait waypoints are injected as direct edges into the routing graph,
bypassing inefficient grid threading through narrow passages.
Each waypoint sequence is pre-validated to be ocean and path-clear.

Note: Very narrow straits (Bosporus, Suez Canal) may have consecutive
waypoints where GSHHS intermediate resolution shows a land crossing.
These are validated against nautical charts, not GSHHS, and strait edges
deliberately skip is_path_clear() during A*.
